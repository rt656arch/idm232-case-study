              "Recipes" is a PHP-based recipe website I designed and developed
              solo over three months to transform an overwhelming collection of
              unorganized PDF recipe files into an accessible, user-friendly
              platform. The main challenge was taking dense,
              difficult-to-navigate documents and creating a searchable,
              filterable database that would allow users to find recipes with
              minimal effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through an iterative three-phase process (Alpha, Beta, and Final),
              I produced the result: a recipe website that successfully
              organizes hundreds of recipes into an easily navigable platform
              designed for people who want to have more fun in the kitchen,
              proving that functional design doesn't have to sacrifice
              personality!

              <li>Background</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              From the end of September until the first week of December, I have
              been the solo UX/UI designer and front-end and back-end developer
              of this course-long PHP project. "Recipes" is a recipe website
              designed for users who want to find a large variety of recipes
              with as little effort as possible.

            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              The problem is that all I was given to begin was a large
              collection of files with recipes that were not organized at all.
              The density of these PDFs are overwhelming and difficult to
              navigate and understand, no one would have been able to
              conveniently search through these if they wanted to.
            </p>

            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              To ensure that the recipe website is efficient, I went into this
              knowing that having a search feature as well as filters would make
              it easier for a user to find the type of recipe they were looking
              for.

          <h2>Process and Insights:</h2>
          <p class="intro-text">
            This project was split into 3 phases: Alpha, Beta, and Final. In
            order to ensure quality work and follow the timeline in an orderly
            fashion, the Alpha was designed to help me as a UX/UI designer lay
            the groundwork.
          </p>

          <!-- Alpha Phase -->
          <div class="step">
            <ol start="1">
              <li>Alpha</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              I started by sketching a layout I wanted to achieve. I was going
              for more of a fun and welcoming feeling by aiming for a rounder
              border radius and a cartoonish icon on the landing.
            </p>
            <div class="placeholder-image"></div>
            <p class="step-content">
              After that, I played around with the colors to decide how I wanted
              the first impression to be. I ultimately decided on a blue theme
              based on my preferences. I wanted to try something new as I tend
              to lean towards a pinker color palette and was hoping to give
              myself a challenge. In addition, the fonts I had chosen were
              further a welcoming feeling with the bubble letters inviting
              whimsy and cute charm.
            </p>
            <div class="placeholder-image"></div>
            <p class="step-content">
              Aside from the aesthetics, I also focused on laying the
              foundational technical work. This includes data-mining and
              cleaning. After receiving the folder of files I had to come
              through, I was able to organize it into a table separating
              important valuables with one another which will be more important
              later in Beta. Despite not needing the database to be linked at
              this time, it was vital for me to start ASAP so that when Beta is
              assigned, I can get started immediately.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Beta Phase -->
          <div class="step">
            <ol start="2">
              <li>Beta</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              After Alpha, I ran the colors I originally used through a color
              contrast checker and realized that the blues I had chosen could be
              difficult to read. Because my main goal was to make gathering
              these recipes more accessible, I ended up changing into a higher
              contrast color palette I was more familiar with: pink and magenta
              (put in hex codes)
            </p>
            <div class="placeholder-image"></div>
            <p class="step-content">
              After determining the color palette, the base I laid in Alpha
              allowed me to build my PHP and run it through rounds of trial and
              error. The pinks I chose seemed to be more friendly to the eye as
              well as more interesting to look at. I finally got to lay out all
              of the data I had collected and successfully inputted into a
              table.
            </p>
            <p class="step-content">
              At this point, the database of the recipes I was collecting
              earlier has now been implemented to the Beta project so I know how
              each of the recipes will look like on the design I have made, This
              also allowed me to ensure the site's responsiveness and debug
              anything that may have been lost when connecting my data.

          <!-- Finals Phase -->
          <div class="step">

            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              Based on the critiques from the last projects, I knew that I had
              to design at a bit of a higher level, include more images, and
              ensure all of my fonts were loading. At this point, my design is
              set in stone, it was a matter of making sure that the PHP code was
              clean.
            </p>
            <div class="placeholder-image"></div>
            <p class="step-content">
              Troubleshooting why some images loaded in while some did not,
              investigating why fonts were not always loading, and also making
              sure I kept my code consistent is where I had lacked. To do this,
              I started implementing a higher level of microinteractions into
              the project. I have added hover states where I can to push the
              narrative I want to portray of something fun and whimsical. In
              addition, I went back to make sure all the images were loading by
              combing through typos. Lastly, ensuring that the font loads is a
              rookie mistake, but going through each line of your CSS and making
              sure it is as optimized as possible takes a lot of time but I
              managed to get it done.

            You may not be able to tell by this screen but behind this has gone
            through many internal conflicts of design hierarchy, spending lots
            of efforts to make sure my database connection was clean, and rounds
            of critiques. Because of all of that, I was able to make "Recipes"
            what it is at its current stage. A recipe website that is easily
            navigable and organized geared for people who want to have more fun.

          <p class="step-content">
            Defining features that would determine whether or not I was
            successful would be the search bar, a wide range of filters to sift
            through, and easily readable text. For this to be as efficient and
            as fun as I wanted it to be I tackled these core things.

              Coming from the stack of pdfs we first received, the product I
              went on to design was to give a place where all of those recipes
              could live at once. To prevent fatigue from the tiring search it
              would've been to read through all those recipes, efficient design
              allows users to search for ingredients they want to use with ease.
              This is solved with my implementation of both the search and
              filter keys.

              Cooking can be intimidating, especially when you might be given a
              large stack of recipes you've never seen before. To ease users in,
              I designed a landing screen to invoke fun and add some character
              which is not common in most other recipe websites (based on
              personal competitor analysis).Using bright and bold/bubbly
              aesthetics brings a warmth to the brand and invites more people to
              come!

            Because this project is a reflection of a hypothetical recipe site,
            its success can be hard to determine. Despite it all, the overall
            design is successful in achieving its goal to be efficient and fun.
            If given more time, I would have liked to include more
            microinteractions to make the website definitely pop. I would also
            try to steer away from my signature color to really push myself to
            design for a wider palette. With the success of the franchise?
            Nooonoo. I have no fear that you will be great, regardless
