Case studies are narratives that reveal what you are capable of. They allow you to walk prospective clients/employers through the contextual details of your existing project work so you can outline your creative strategy from conception to completion. Write in the client’s perspective so potential clients can easily relate. tell a story about the client’s needs and your design process. Write about the project, not about yourself. Remember, the best case studies are not intuition based. Instead, they document the rationale behind the design, UX, and visual decisions.

The Overview
This the executive summary of your case study. It allows your prospects to quickly understand the highlights of your past work without reading the entire thing. This section should include the core takeaways from all other sections including the main problem, an overview of the solution, and key results. This is typically written last, so that you can scan for the main points from each section below and summarize them into a one or two paragraph synopsis.

Overview:

Context and Challenge
This section is designed to provide your prospective client with a detailed description of the context that led to the creation of the project, and can be distilled into three main elements:

Background / Description / Timeline / Budget / Purpose
The Problem: Define why this project exists and what problem it seeks to solve.
Goals & Objectives: What are the metrics that will define if this project is successful. What are the tangible goals.
Give a quick overview of the project. What were the goals for the project. Keep the focus on problem-solving, not just asset delivery. Define if it was a solo or team based project. If team based, what your role was on the project.

Context and Challenges:

1. Background
   From the end of September until the first week of December, I have been the solo UX/UI designer and front-end and back-end devloper of this course-long PHP project. "Recipes" is a recipe website designed for users who want to find a large variety of recipes with as little efforts as possible.

2. Problem
   The problem is that all I was given to begin was a large collection of files with recipes that were not organized at all. The density of these PDFs are overwhelming and difficult to navigate and understand, no one would have been able to conveiniently search through these if they wanted to.

3. Goals/Objectives
   To ensure that the recipe website is efficient, I went into this knowing that having a search feature as well as filters would make it easier for a user to find the type of recipe they were looking for.

Process and Insight
This section should elaborate on your design process. How did you go about developing the final solution. What were the steps that will help the reader to visualize the work and, more importantly, to see that it was created by human beings. We want see how the final came into being, not just what the piece looks like at the end. These could include (but not limited to) research:

Design Sketches
Wireframes
Style Guide
Prototypes
Code/Dev
UX Testing Notes
Final Project

Process and Insights:
This project was split into 3 phases: Alpha, Beta, and Final. In order to ensure quality work and follow the timeline in an orderly fashion, the Alpha was designed to help me as a UX/UI designer lay the groundwork.

Alpha:
I started by sketching a layout I wanted to acheive. I was going for more of a fun and welcoming feeling by aiming for a rounder border radius and a cartoonish icon on the landing.

After that, I played around with the colors to decide how I wanted the first impression to be. I ultimately decided on a blue theme based on my preferances. I wanted to try something new as I tend to lean towards a pinker color palette and was oping to give myself of a challenge. In addition, the fonts I had chose were further a welcoming feeling with the bubble letters inviting whimsy and cute charm.

Aside from the aesthetics, I also focused on laying the foundational technical work. This includes data-mining and cleaning. After recieving the folder of files I had to come through, I was able to organize it into a table separating important valuables with one another which will be more important later in Beta. Despite not needing the database to be linked at this time, it was vital for me to start ASAP so that when Beta is assigned, I can get started immediately.

Beta:
After Alpha, I ran the colors I originallys used through a color contrast checker and realized that the blues I had chose could be difficult to read. Because my main goal was to make gathering these recipes more accessible, I ended up changing into a higher contrast color palette I was more familiar with: pink and magenta (put in hex codes)

After determining the color palette, the base I laid in Alpha allowed me to build my PHP and run it through rounds of trial and error. The pinks I chose seemed to be more friendly to the eye as well as more interesting to look at. I finally got to layout all of the data I had collected and successfully inputted into a table.
At this point, the database of the recipes I was collecting earlier has now been implemented to the

The Solution
This is where you get to show off your final design with detailed images and videos, and a link to the live project if available. Describe your design work. Take the time to explain in detail your site’s defining features like its UX, navigation structure, content strategy, or unique mobile attributes. If you put the effort into crafting descriptions that complement your visual assets, your readers will feel much more confident in your decisions as a designer/developer.

The Results
A quick wrap up. Was the project a success and why. Do you have qualitative and quantitative success metrics from your project? These should directly address the objectives you established in The Context and Challenge section. If this is client work, include a client testimonial. This also is an opportunity to define the lessons learned and what you would change about your process / approach in the future.
